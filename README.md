# Hyper API Samples
[![Tableau Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Tableau%20Supported-53bd92.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools) 
[![Community Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Community%20Supported-457387.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

This repo is the home of the Hyper API samples. It contains both __Tableau-Supported Samples__ and __Community-Supported Samples__:
-  The official samples are packaged and shipped within the Hyper API itself. All of the official samples are available for each language supported by the Hyper API: Python, Java, C++, and C#/.Net (.NET Standard 2.0) and are entirely supported and maintained by Tableau.
- The community samples focus on individual use cases and are Python-only. They have been written by members of the Tableau development team but receive the level of 'Community Supported' as they may not be maintained in newer releases. Each of the samples has been manually tested and reviewed before publishing and will still be open to pull requests and issues.
- See our [support page](https://www.tableau.com/support/itsupport) for more information.

## What is the Hyper API?
For the unfamiliar, the Hyper API contains a set of functions you can use to automate your interactions with Tableau extract (.hyper) files. You can use the API to create new extract files, or to open existing files, and then insert, delete, update, or read data from those files. Using the Hyper API developers and administrators can:
* Create extract files for data sources not currently supported by Tableau.
* Automate custom extract, transform and load (ETL) processes (for example, implement rolling window updates or custom incremental updates).
* Retrieve data from an extract file.



## How do I install the Hyper API?
It is a prerequisite that to work with these code samples, the Hyper API is installed in your language of choice. Head to our [official Hyper API Documentation](https://tableau.github.io/hyper-db/docs) to get it up and running.



## How do I get help or give feedback?
If you have questions, want to submit ideas, or give feedback on the code, please do so by submitting an issue on this project.
